*-------------------------------------------------------------*
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE THIS FOLDER:
*-------------------------------------------------------------*

Inside the TunisiaDemocracy folder, create the following sub-folders before running any do-file:
•	figures 
•	graphs 
•	logs 
•	tables 
•	data

Move all datasets into the folder “data”.

The empty sub-folders will be used to place the outputs generated by the do-files. All do-files and sub-folders should be in the same folder, respecting the sub-folders already created.

Here are the steps to replicate all the tables appearing in the main manuscript and appendix: 

1.	Before you start, be sure you have the following ado-files install in your computer: 

*ssc install blindschemes 
*ssc install estout, all replace
*ssc install estwrite
*ssc install sumstats
*ssc install outreg2


If you do not have these ado-files, remove the symbol (*) and run this part of the do-file. Once you install these ado-files in your computer, we advise to comment out these lines to prevent multiple reinstallations. 

Do-files for this paper were run in Stata/SE 16.0 for Mac (64-bit Intel)
Revision 11 Dec 2019
Version 13 is called in do-files to recognise former ado-files for table formatting 


2.	Now you can start working on the replication of tables and figures.  You can start with any table/figure you want. This means, all do-files can be run separately. We recommend starting with Table 2 and Table 3 running “table2_3.tunisia.do”. This do-file contains a brief explanation of what we do in there and a set of globals that contain a “main” path.  Change the path according to your own PC/Mac paths. For PC users, please add the symbol “ \” to each of the path definitions in globals; for instance, for global data you will need to include “ \ “ right after “${main}” as in "${main}\data\tunisia_democracy_replication.dta".  The section in bold text, is the only line you will need to change. Here we put an example of the globals we use, highlighting the path that you will need to change based on your own computer’s path:

clear 
	
	global	main		"/Users/TunisiaDemocracy/"		
	global 	data 		"${main}data/tunisia_democracy_replication.dta"
	global 	logs		"${main}logs/TunisiaDemocracy_main_manuscript.log"
	global 	tables 		"${main}tables"										

3.	After running “table2_3.tunisia.do” or any of the do-files reproducing tables, you will have 3 types of files: .tex, .txt and xls.  We have used the .tex version to report in the manuscript. 
4.	Run “table4_5_tunisia.do” to replicate Tables 4 and 5. 
5.	Run “table6_tunisia.do” to replicate Table 6. 

Figures and Tables in Appendix:

6.	Run “tableA.1_tunisia_appendix.do” to replicate Table A.1
7.	Run “tableA.2_tunisia_Arabbarometer_descriptives_Appendix” to replicate Table A.2 base on the publicly available ArabBarometer dataset.
8.	Run “tableA.2_tunisia_sample_descriptives_Appendix.do” to replicate Table A.2 sample of statistics based on the sample collected by authors. 
9.	Run “tableA.3.tunisia_appendix” to replicate Table A.3. 
10.	Run “tableA.4_Table2_NO_PRE-VARS_Appendix” to replicate Table A.4. Same dependent variables as in Table 2, but having no pre-treatment variables, only treatment dummies.
11.	Run “tableA.5_Table3_tunisia_top_panel_NO_PRE-VARS_Appendix”. Same dependent variables as in Table 3, but having no pre-treatment variables, only treatment dummies. 
12.	Run “tableA.6_tunisia_appendix” to replicate Table A.6.
13.	Run “tableA.7_tunisia_appendix” to replicate Table A.7.

The macro data used is based on three separate datasets"

DATASET 1: GEDDES ET AL. 2014 - TRANSITIONS

Transitions - used in Figure A.1 - were classified using the data by Geddes, Wright and Frantz (2014). The data can be downloaded from https://sites.psu.edu/dictators/ (dataset “Autocratic Regimes”) and more information about the variables is available here: https://xmarquez.github.io/democracyData/reference/gwf_all.html.

DATASET 2: Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) - country macro indicators 

The data displayed in Figure A.1 is taken from V-Dem, version 10 "Country-Year: V-Dem Full+Others". The data can be downloaded here: https://v-dem.net/dsarchive.html. 

The codebook with exact definitions of each variable used here is available in the data folder as well when downloading the data via the link above.
